# fortune-python
Quick python 2.7 script to implement a simple fortune

This is not meant to be a full implementation.

I have the flags -o and -d.

-o will pull fortunes from the obscene file.
-d will print some debugging information

Any other string (not -o not -o) will cause the program to 
try to open it as a fortune source.

Note:  fortune files are human readable text seperated by %%
(I borrowed the original BSD files for this scene and obscene)
